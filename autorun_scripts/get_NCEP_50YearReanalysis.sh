#  Script that get NCEP wind files for the year specified.  
#  This script is run at the beginning of the new year, to complete the NCEP record of
#  the previous year's wind files.  But it can also be run to get the wind files for
#  any previous year.  This script is invoked by typing:
#    ./get_NCEP_50YearReanalysis.sh $year
#  where $year is the year you want to get.

# This is the location where the downloaded windfiles will be placed.
# Please edit this to suit your system.
